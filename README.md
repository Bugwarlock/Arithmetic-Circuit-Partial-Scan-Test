# Arithmetic Circuit Partial Scan Test
In this project, we designed a four function module that calculates SIN and COS and SINH and COSH by using Taylor series. After that, we used ATALANTA and Hope aplications in order to analyze the circuit then we tested it with scan method and apply it by Verilog simulation and achieve our goal coverage. Finally, we implemented Golomb compressor and generate output.
This project is done as mid-term project of Test and Tesability course.
